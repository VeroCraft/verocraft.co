My name is Candace Welch and I hail from the bustling city of Montgomery, Alabama. I am a Graphic Designer with a knack for development. The growth of Front End Development has stagnated, leaving several developers to wonder what comes next. I am passionate about my career, and I strive to keep myself current and relative within the market. I am eager to continue learning throughout my career as a Software Developer unfolds in an ever changing environment.
