Recovering research psychologist, current amateur mathematician, and STEM enthusiast:

* I have a passion for problem-solving, logic, and interfacing with people I can learn from. Currently, Iâ€™m looking to dive feet-first into a software development job that will enable me to contribute to a greater societal good.
* My interest in programming originates from coding in SAS and R for data analysis. I later taught myself some Python and took MOOCs to code small games and projects, and discovered a love of creating my own content.
* I am results-driven, a continuous learner, and motivated to improve the experiences of those around me in practical ways.
