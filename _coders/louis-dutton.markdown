I have always had a fascination with computers and games and have always enjoy what software development can do for the world. I have worked in the field of Pharmacy for about 12 years in total I have enjoyed my time working and studying in the field of Medicine. While working I have increasingly notice the lack of efficient universal software development and data portability in the field of pharmacy and other medical fields. I have had a desire to learn and work with computer programs and enjoyed my time studying in class to program and look forward into working with developers who are passionate about their work.
