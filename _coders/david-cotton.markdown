My name is David Cotton, I have been passionate about programming since the third grade when a friend of mine asked for help on a project. What fascinates me about programing is the  way I can  manipulate data and custom features to showcase anything I can imagine. Since then I have taught myself a various amount of programming languages and have worked on a great number projects utilizing my skill set and expanding my knowledge base. It is my desire to work for a company that I can be apart of a small team that is developing and helping to solve real world, everyday challenges.
