In looking for a change from sales, I have been actively pursuing computer programming since 2014. My background in B2B sales cultivated excellent interpersonal skills, and a talent for developing and maintaining relationships with clients and coworkers was very valuable experience working as a part of a team. Passionate about technology and about learning.
