My name is Tori Riddle, I have a Graphic Design background. Since I was young, I have always been intrigued with problem solving and how everything works. Through my design career, I have been assigned projects that required me to self teach myself on basic web programming, I am very adaptive at learning new skills.  This peaked an interest in the development field. Design is parallel with programming and is a crucial factor. Having a design background will be beneficial in creating the overall UX/UI design. I do great working on a team or alone,  I am eager to continue learning as a developer and designer in our ever changing environment.
