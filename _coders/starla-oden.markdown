I fell in love with graphic design in college and considered web development a next step and interesting skill to learn. I moved to Austin at the end of 2016 for a new experience and started teaching myself new skills. I am passionate about advancing my knowledge as a developer and designer and would love to be a part of a creative team to contribute to development projects and utilize my graphic design skills.
