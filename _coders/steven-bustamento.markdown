My name is Steven, I’m an Alabama native who is extremely passionate about what I do. I’ve spent a few years traveling the country performing and have fallen in love with a productive team environment that is always chasing improvement. I want to combine my addiction to this environment, tech, and my interest in problem solving and creation to flourish in the role as a developer. I’ve become very interested in how we can use technology to enhance our brain's natural abilities, and hope to one day be on a team that is helping people who can’t see, or hear, use technology as an alternative means of perceiving the world.
