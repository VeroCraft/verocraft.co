  - Who I am as a person, how I’ve gotten to where I am.
  - Highlight my attributes.
  - Had a problem I couldn’t solve, and I decided to learn how to fix it.
  - I want to take what I’ve learned and apply those skills and that knowledge
- I enjoy working with syntax highlighting for very many reasons: 
  - Analyze the syntax, structure, and makeup of various languages.
  - Text/Code/Language parsing; finding common patterns & idioms across different programming languages.
