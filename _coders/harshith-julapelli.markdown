  body: Emergency mail sender is an android application targeted for many users who
    cannot access their mobiles for long duration of time. EMS sends the missed calls
    and message details to the user specified email id. Few times by not attempting
    Calls/Messages for long hours we may need to face few issues later. To avoid this,
    we are coming up with an application where we can integrate the mobile with SMTP
    email system so that employee/user will get the notification of email or SMS to
    their email client which is installed at his/her work stations.
