First interest in programing 150-250w - After having spent several years in the sales and marketing world I realized it is not how I wanted to spend the rest of my professional career. All through school, software development was always on my short list to study. Now that C# programming is my primary focus I couldnâ€™t be more excited to absorb as much information as I can and use it to create in demand software. -what I am hoping to find/give in a job-

- C# Software development
- Git and Git Hub distributed 
- Bullet point
- Another bullet point
