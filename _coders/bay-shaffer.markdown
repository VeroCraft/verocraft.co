I have a passion for launching and accelerating businesses with a focus on sustainable growth. Understanding, measuring, and improving the value your company delivers to customers extends across multiple departments in an organization. I'm a coder, founder, growth advisor, mentor, small business advocate, and investment scout. My experience led me to JavaScript, C# and the .NET framework. Seeking an opportunity in website development or software development. Interested in:

- Website Development
- Software Development
- Programming
- Growth Hacking
