My interest in software development was sparked at a young age when I had a desire to learn the mechanics of how the video games I was playing were built, that fascination with wanting to know how things were built lead me to pursue a degree in mechanical engineering at Auburn University. After a short amount of time I realized my true passion for computers and technology was with the software side and not hardware. I am a fast learner and a hard worker, who desires to be apart of an energetic team building exciting software. At some point in my career I would love the opportunity to follow what originally got me excited about programming by creating the games that I enjoyed so much as a kid.
